This program has multiple functions:
  - The Main Menu can be run as 'manageExpenses.py' and it can:
      - Add an expense to a current CSV of expenses for a year or create a new CSV and record that expense

      - Modify a record found by searching and changing a field of information
      - Add a Default Category, Name, or Payment Method to the program
  - The Reports Menu can be run as 'manageExpenses.py --report' and it can:
      - Create a text or CSV of an annual summed expense category or name for many years
      - Create a text or CSV of annual summed expenses for all the names under a category for many years
      - Create a text or CSV of summed monthly expenses for a year
